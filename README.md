bpch content has been removed to prevent accidental use.

The bpch functionality here was always (and is) part of [PseudoNetCDF](http://github.com/barronh/pseudonetcdf). The duplication in this package was meant to make use easy. I am not convinced it was easier to use, and it was much harder to maintain duplicates.

Conclusion: This package is deprecated in favor of [PseudoNetCDF](http://github.com/barronh/pseudonetcdf).


Use [PseudoNetCDF](http://github.com/barronh/pseudonetcdf)

If you refuse to use PseudoNetCDF, you can use the archived version in the "Deprecated Archive" release. Don't ask for help.
